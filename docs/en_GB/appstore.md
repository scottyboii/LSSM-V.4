# Appstore :shopping_cart:

The Appstore is one of the central elements of LSS Manager. Here you can (de-)activate each module individually. A brief description of each module is also provided directly in the appstore.
So that you can easily get a deeper insight into the module without having to activate the module first, the wiki entry of each module is accessible via the small blue `i`.

:::tip Changes
If you have unsaved changes, you cannot close the Appstore, a small hint message will appear.

:::warning Support of the map type "MapKit"
There are a few modules that are not supported when MapKit is selected as the map type. This is because some functionality is not provided by MapKit itself. A complete list of these modules can be found at [‚ÑπÔ∏è General information on modules](apps.md).

For the same reason, there are also some minor restrictions for MapKit users.
