Also, a big thank you goes out to our translators who volunteer their time to make the LSSM usable in other versions of the game.</br>To celebrate, we\'d like to share a few facts and figures here:<ul><li><code>February 10th 2020</code>: The First Commit on GitHub was made: <a href="https://github.com/LSS-Manager/LSSM-V.4/commit/6e95836" target="_blank">6e95836</a>.
