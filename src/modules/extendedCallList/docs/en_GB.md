This module aims to enhance the mission list, as it is very basic within the core game.

## Remaining Mission Time
This setting shows you the exact time left until completion of the mission.

### Remaining Time Only For Green Missions
If deactivated, this setting allows for you to allow the time to also show when the mission is in yellow status.

## Mark Missions
You can press the star icon next to a mission name to make it appear at the top of the mission list. This can be done from either the mission list or in the dispatch screen.

## Show Earnings
This will show the average earnings of that type of mission.
